### Run

The following is the output from the highschool model:

This model simulates the spread of measles in a highschool. The
highschool has 1000 students, and the simulation runs for 60 days with
one index case. We can check that transitions between states looking at
the transition matrix:

    Transition Probabilities:
     - Susceptible              1.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00
     - Exposed                  0.00  0.68  0.19  0.00  0.00  0.11  0.00  0.02  0.00
     - Prodromal                0.00  0.00  0.70  0.26  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.04  0.00
     - Rash                     0.00  0.00  0.00  0.48  0.52  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00
     - Isolated                 0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.72  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.28
     - Quarantined Exposed      0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.86  0.00  0.14  0.00
     - Quarantined Susceptible  0.08  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.92  0.00  0.00
     - Quarantined Infectious   0.00  0.00  0.05  0.00  0.22  0.00  0.00  0.73  0.00
     - Recovered  

From it, we see:

- Exposed can move to prodromal, quarantined exposed, or quarantined
  infectious.
- Prodromal moves to Rash or Quarantined Prodromal (which is
  infectious).
- Rash moves to Isolated (and triggers contact tracing).
- Isolated moves to Recovered (full immunity).
- Quarantined Exposed either moves to quarantined infectious or to
  isolated. It can moved to exposed, but since the quarantine period is
  14 days, we donâ€™t see any case.
- Quarantined Infectious moves to prodromal (if exits quarantine) or to
  isolated (if rash detected), in which case contact tracing is
  triggered.

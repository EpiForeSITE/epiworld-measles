# School quarantine model


## School quarantine model for new_bridge_88_npi

This model is a discrete-time Agent-Based Model \[ABM\] that includes
the following features:

**Disease progression:**

- Susceptible individuals can aquire the virus from agents in the
  prodromal or rash state (as long as they are not isolated or
  quarantined).
- Exposed individuals develop the disease to transition to the prodromal
  state.
- Prodromal individuals develop the disease to transition to the rash
  state.
- Rash individuals are isolated.

**Quarantine process:**

- Individuals developing rash trigger quarantining process.
- Vaccinated individuals are skipped.
- Unvaccinated individuals may reject moving to quarantine.
- Individuals in quarantine who develop the disease trigger contact
  tracing as well.

**Vaccination:**

- Agents can be vaccinated at the beginning of the simulation.
- Vaccinated agents are less susceptible to the disease.
- Recovered agents are treated as immune.

### Parameters

The following is a raw list of the parameters included in the model:

| Parameter | Value | Reference |
|:---|---:|:---|
| Contact rate | 2.38 | Negative binomial. Calibrated using R0=15 as a reference. |
| Incubation period | 12.00 | Geometric + 1. Ref.: Jones and Baranowski (2019) |
| Days undetected | 2.00 | Fixed value. |
| Prodromal period | 3.00 | Geometric + 1. Ref.: Jones and Baranowski (2019) |
| Quarantine days | 21.00 | Utah Measles Disease Plan (“Measles Disease Plan” 2019). |
| Rash period | 4.00 | Geometric + 1. Ref.: “Measles Disease Plan” (2019). |
| Transmission rate | 0.90 | Prob. of transmission fixed. Calibrated using R0=15 as a reference. |
| Vax improved recovery | 0.50 | Fixed value. |
| Vax efficacy | 0.99 | Prob. efficacy fixed. Ref.: Liu et al. (2015). |
| R0 | 15.00 | Theoretical R0. |

Other parameters can be found the corresponding parameters document
[here](params.yaml).

### Run

This model simulates the spread of measles in a highschool. The
highschool has students, and the simulation runs for days with one index
case. The following is the output from the highschool model:

``` r
library(epiworldR)

abm <- with(temp_params, {
  ModelMeaslesQuarantine(
    n = `Population size`,
    prevalence = 1,
    contact_rate = `Contact rate`,
    transmission_rate = `Transmission rate`,
    incubation_period = `Incubation period`,
    prodromal_period = `Prodromal period`,
    rash_period = `Rash period`,
    days_undetected = `Days undetected`,
    quarantine_days = `Quarantine days`,
    vax_efficacy = `Vax efficacy`,
    vax_improved_recovery = `Vax improved recovery`,
    prop_vaccinated = `Vaccination rate`,
    quarantine_willigness = `Quarantine willingness`
  )
})


saver <- make_saver("total_hist", "transition", "reproductive", "transition")

set.seed(3312)
run_multiple(
  abm, ndays = temp_params$`N days`,
  nthreads = temp_params$Threads,
  nsims = temp_params$`Replicates`,
  saver = saver
  )
```

## Outbreak size

Estimating the outbreak size:

|--------:|:---------------|:-------------------------|
|  2.0000 | 0.62           | \[2.00, 9.85\]           |
|  5.0000 | 0.17           | \[5.00, 12.00\]          |
| 10.0000 | 0.02           | \[10.00, 15.67\]         |
| 20.0000 | \< 0.01        | \-                       |
|  2.0000 | Median (50%\>) | \[3.00, 11.00\]          |
|  2.7325 | Mean (average) | \[3.00, 11.00\]          |

Preparing the data for output

The following figure shows the cummulative number of new cases (detected
or not) over time. Cases can be identified with the following
transitions:

- Susceptible to Exposed.
- Susceptible to Quarantined Exposed.

### Reproductive number of the index case

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/reproductive-number-1.png)

Althougth the model was calibrated with an R0 of 15, adding vaccination,
a smaller population, and quarantine changes (lowers) the reproductive
number:

    Mean Rt:1.1035

    Median Rt:1

    95% CI Rt:0,4

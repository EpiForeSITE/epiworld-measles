# Models of school quarantine

The different runs here include:

- New Bridge 88: 88% vaccination rate, no NPIs ([link](new_bridge_88.md)).
- New Bridge 88 NPI: 88% vaccination rate, NPIs ([link](new_bridge_88_npi.md)).
- Canyon grove 58: 58% vaccination rate, no NPIs ([link](canyon_grove_58.md)).
- Canyon grove 58 NPI: 58% vaccination rate, NPIs ([link](canyon_grove_58_npi.md)).

The NPI runs have quarantine willingness set to 1.0, which means that all individuals will accept quarantine if they develop the disease. Otherwise, there's no quarantine or isolation whatsoever.

All runs were calibrated using an R0 of 15.

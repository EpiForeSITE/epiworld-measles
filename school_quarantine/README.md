- Edgemont 92 NPI: 92% vaccination rate, NPIs ([link](edgemont_92_npi.md)).
- Canyon Crest 74: 74% vaccination rate, no NPIs ([link](canyon_crest_74.md)).
- Canyon Crest 74 NPI: 74% vaccination rate, NPIs ([link](canyon_crest_74_npi.md)).

The NPI runs have quarantine willingness set to 1.0, which means that all individuals will accept quarantine if they develop the disease. Otherwise, there's no quarantine or isolation whatsoever.

All runs were calibrated using an R0 of 15.
